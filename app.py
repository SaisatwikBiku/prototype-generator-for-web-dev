    prompt = f"""
    As an expert in professional web development, create a comprehensive, high-fidelity HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codebase that meets the following project description: {description}.

    The code should adhere to the following requirements:
    1. A well-structured HTML5 document starting with <!DOCTYPE html> and including all essential sections like <head>, <body>, semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>), with thoughtful use of <div> and <span> elements as needed for layout precision.
    2. A highly responsive design with finely-tuned media queries that seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring all elements scale gracefully.
    3. Utilize CSS Grid or Flexbox exclusively for a clean, modern layout, with each section logically organized and aligned. Aim for balanced spacing and alignment that achieves a polished, pixel-perfect look.
    4. Placement and formatting of the following images within the layout, styled with appropriate dimensions, padding, and alignment to maintain aesthetic balance: {images_html}.
    5. Embedded, self-contained CSS styles that avoid external libraries (e.g., Bootstrap). Select a refined, modern color palette that enhances readability and supports a cohesive design theme.
    6. Implement JavaScript for interactivity in a clean, modular way. Focus on essential features like form handling, content toggling, button actions, and a smooth navigation experience.
    7. A minimalist, accessible navigation bar positioned at the top of the layout, and a footer with relevant content at the bottom. The navigation bar should include hover and active states to indicate current page sections.
    8. Consistent, visually appealing typography using a Google font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans', with deliberate choices in font size, weight, and spacing to enhance readability and professionalism.
    9. Attention to detail in UI consistency, ensuring all sizes, colors, and spacing choices contribute to a unified and professional design. Maintain uniform margins, padding, and alignment for all elements.
    10. The output should be a complete and standalone 'index.html' file, with embedded CSS and JavaScript, containing no comments or additional text, ready for immediate use. There should not be any other text other than the executable code.

        - Position the logo in an optimal location, such as the top-left corner, making it clear yet balanced within the header.
        - Adjust the logo dimensions to ensure clarity and proportion across screen sizes, using padding to maintain visual separation from other elements.
        - Style the logo in harmony with the chosen theme, allowing it to naturally complement the pageâ€™s color scheme.
